- [x] Ability to extract shape dimensions from a design file
- [x] Ability to generate a thumbnail or preview image from a design file
- [ ] Ability to upload design files via a web interface
- [ ] Ability to view a list of design files via a web interface
- [ ] Ability to view a design file's information via a web interface
- [ ] Ability to record a variant of a design file (Gcode + Slicer profile + notes)

### Nice to have

- [ ] Plugins to automatically store variants from Cura
- [ ] Plugins to automatically store variants from Slic3r
- [ ] Ability to interact with library via CLI
- [ ] Possibly trying to package the frontend into an Electron.js desktop app
- [ ] View design file in 3D space
- [ ] Generate preview from gcode file
- [ ] Extract settings from slicer profile
- [ ] Printer integration

### Out of scope
