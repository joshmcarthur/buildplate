- [ ] Ability to record a variant of a design file (Gcode + Slicer profile + notes)

### Nice to have

- [ ] Plugins to automatically store variants from Cura
- [ ] Plugins to automatically store variants from Slic3r
- [ ] Ability to interact with project via CLI
- [ ] Possibly trying to package the frontend into an Electron.js desktop app

### Out of scope
